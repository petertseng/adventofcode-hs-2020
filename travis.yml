# The Travis docs (https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/haskell)
# suggest that we use `language: haskell` and `ghc:` to specify GHC versions.
# However, as of this writing, Travis only supported versions up to 7.8.
# If Travis supports all versions we would like to test, then we could switch.
# Until then, we use the https://github.com/haskell-CI/haskell-ci setup.
